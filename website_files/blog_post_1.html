			<p>The developing team of Tony has been split into smaller sub-groups which helps enhance the quality of the game for you. The technical programmers and the creative designers all played an important part in the development, to make Tony a great experience for you all. A quick list of creators and developers of TONY.</p>
			<p><b>Reedwan</b> – Team Leader / Web Developer</p>
			<p><b>Owen</b> – Senior programmer</p>
			<p><b>Charlie</b> – Web Developer </p>
			<p><b>Alek</b> – Graphics Designer </p>
			<p><b>Kush</b> – Graphics Designer / UI Developer</p>
			<p><b>Mak</b> – Programming Developer</p>
			<p><b>Asad</b> – Programming Developer</p>
			<p><b>Vivek</b> – Audio and Visuals designer / UI Designer</p>
			<p>The name of our project is called Tony. It is a strategy, puzzled focused, role-play game where the main character (Tony) goes about his daily life throughout this gameplay. You will be able to play a part within Tony’s life throughout seven levels guiding him through his childhood, adolescence and young adult life experiencing how each of these stages in his life affected, his mental health and him as a person in order to affect his life actions and choices later in his life. </p>
			<p>You will be tested by puzzle-solving and strategy skills throughout the game. As levels go on, the game has a darker theme, both aesthetically and thematically.  The difficulty will be increased in increments over time. The map will be darkened, limiting the viewing distance of the player, making you more prone into deciding – leading you on to solving the puzzles quickly, in a race against the clock in order to complete the level. This way, making the most effective use of your time and ensuring you can make the best possible choices while considering Tony’s future life and what would be best for him not just now but later during his life?</p>
