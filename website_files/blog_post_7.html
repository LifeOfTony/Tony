			<p> Recreating, resizing and redesigning the graphics (Inc. Sprites)</p>
		<div class="card">
			<h5>10th January 2020</h5>
			<img src="img/tony_logo.png" alt="Logo">
			<br>
			<p>At this time, most of the Tony and the NPCs character sprites had been completed in terms of designing and translating them into a sprite sheet which includes their various states which would be used for animation. In addition, there have been some interactable items that have also been created. </p>
			<p>However, due to my misunderstanding of graphic specifications, the sprites were 28-bit rather than the 32-bit they should be. Therefore, I had a new task to correct the sizes and resize what we already had. </p>
			<p>During the process, I had realized that I had more pixels to work with therefore I could do small tweaks to the character designs, giving them more detail and in turn more personality. The body of characters, as well as their arms, were made slightly bigger to better accompany their huge heads. Additional colour shading was added to the clothes and the faces to emulate greater detail. This resizing process took a decent chunk of time because it essentially meant a minor redesign of all the characters, but it turned out for the better. </p>
			<p>The items are easier to resize because of their simplistic nature and after the character sprites are resized and submitted, I can focus on the items that would appear in the game levels.â€ƒ </p>
