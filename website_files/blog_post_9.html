			<p>After the process of resizing and redesigning the previously created graphics such as character sprites and some of the essential items. It was time to design the items which would be used to create the levels.</p>
			<p>For the office levels, smaller objects were designed such as the coffee machine and the mugs, then larger items were needed such as cubicles and chairs. Due to the size and the limitations of the 32-bit style we were going for, clarity was my main focus. Unfortunately, for extremely small items such as the mugs and table fans, clarity was rather difficult to achieve due to the size of the items on the screen.</p>
			<p>It was also requested that I make cubicles for the “executives” within the office, for which I redesigned the usual cubicles to have darker walls and an opaque glass roof to distinguish it from the other cubicles.</p>
			<p>For the house levels, I started by designing the larger furniture such as sofas and tables as well as kitchen appliances such as the refrigerator and the work surface. This process is still on-going as of right now and the next step will be to design the smaller graphics such as picture frames and balloons which should give the house more personality and would be a more enjoyable environment for our player's gameplay experience.</p>
