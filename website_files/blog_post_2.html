			<p>We will build this game using the C# library: monogame. The reason for using this is because we feel as even though some members of our team may not have full knowledge of the language, it will not be too difficult to adapt skills learnt from Java and tailor them towards C#. This being method of development as it allows us to have maximum flexibility for our game. Also, as certain members are more confident in the language, we will be able to carry out more complex programming tasks to maximise the quality of our game.</p>
			<p>The unique 2D game will be arcadia graphics style based and will be a top-down view so users will get more of a feel for the game and fulfil that RPG satisfaction. Users can see the map for that level in a birds-eye view, in which they can navigate around that map using the arrow keys.</p>
			<p>We decided to go with a retro-style game which is more of a classic gaming style, unlike modern gaming, it will not have downtime due to network failure as the game does not require internet access in order to play. This style has become popular in recent years and a re-growing trend as many people reminisce on old school gameplay especially as old school console games are being remade such as classic Nintendo or the original PlayStation console games are being remade and republished for modern consoles. When will retro ever be boring or get old?</p
			<p>Tony will support 16-bit platforms making it accessible for pretty much anyone to play this retro-style arcadia game so regardless of what type of digital device they have, they can still play the game.</p>
