			<p>Tony is a single-player game and will be targeting user audiences of age sixteen and older, this is because we feel this is appropriate as it has a dark-themed nature that is based around mental health.</p>
			<p>As Tony is a retro-styled based game it is implemented for users to finish the game completely in one attempt as there are no checkpoints. So, users will be unable to return to certain parts of the game meaning they cannot afford to lose, as they will have to restart the whole game again from the beginning. Furthermore, there is no pause button available during a challenge so once the player's attempt has started, they will not be able to stop without sacrificing the outcome of the puzzle. The combination of the puzzling strategy will keep the game interesting as well as keeping users engaged in completing the game.</p>
			<p>The structure of our game play screen we intend to have created for the actual game itself will follow a traditional layout. This being the main element of the screen will be the map view which will vary depending on the viewing distance which the player is able to see. At the bottom of the page, we intend to have a user bar which will contain some of the player's inventory items, all menu /option/settings buttons which we intend to have regarding the functionality of the game. The user bar will also include the profile picture of the player who is playing the game, to add a personalised touch to the game in addition to the mental health status bar and the stage at which Tony is currently at.</p>
