			<p>We wanted most, if not all, of the graphics in Tony to be original. This would allow us to have full freedom with how we wanted the game to look which will, in turn, dictate what the player feels as they play our game. After deciding on this, now what?</p>
			<p>The first graphic task I tried to tackle was the character designs, more specifically for our main character, Tony. Due to the nature of the story where Tony is just an ordinary guy struggling through his middle-age, trying to survive the corporate world, the challenge was in making Tony bland but lovable.</p>
			<p>Eventually, using a 28-bit grid in Adobe Illustrator and using dark-grey rectangle shapes that strictly adhere to the guidelines of the grid, I managed to create a rough base for Tony. This base will also morph into the outline which will differentiate Tony with the environments that he is put in. I then started experimenting with his facial features and skin tone. With the “pixel-art” nature of our game, I was positively limited in terms of the detail that I can put in the characters so, this meant that I am forced to keep features simple and straight-to-the-point. Tony’s skin tone was difficult because I wanted to keep him looking ordinary in terms of features, he’d look sickly and unlikeable if his skin was too pale, therefore I opted to give him a younger, tanned skin-tone so that he would still be fun to play as.</p>
			<p>After focusing on Tony and the characters different sprite states that he will go through such as; profile, front-view, and walking states; I started creating the vital handheld lantern which he will carry throughout the game to represent his mental state. Due to the already small size of Tony I only really had around 12 pixels to work with for the lantern, therefore, I opted to show the progression of the lantern with colours instead of showing the oil running out.</p>
